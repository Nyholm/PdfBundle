## CSS To Inline
In this bundle there's also a CSS To Inline utility class included. It is based
upon the [CssToInlineStyles](https://github.com/tijsverkoyen/CssToInlineStyles) class from [@tijsverkoyen](https://github.com/tijsverkoyen).

## Documentation
The main Documentation can be found in Resources/doc/index.html. It is
auto-generated by PHPDocumentor2. The directory itself is excluded trough git
because we use the [PHPDoc Markdown](https://github.com/evert/phpdoc-md) plugin to create proper MD files to
include in Git.
